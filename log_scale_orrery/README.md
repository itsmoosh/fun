Creates a log scale solar system diagram for any specified date.
	Defaults to the day I met Nichole or the day we got married,
	in the event that ephem module is not installed.

This program was created to make a radial-log-scale orrery (planet
	alignment chart) so that the planets could all be easily
	distinguished at the size of a tattoo. Please direct questions
	or comments to itsmoosh@gmail.com.

Prerequisites:
	Python 3,
	PyEphem ('ephem' module)

	Information about PyEphem can be found at: http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/

Instructions:
	Run from the Terminal as "python3 log_scale_orrery.py" (no quotes).


Adjust highlighted toggles/numbers to modify the output plot. Toggles
	all appear near the top of the script, just below module imports.
